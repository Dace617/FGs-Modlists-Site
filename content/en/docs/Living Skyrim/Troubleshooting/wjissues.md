  Common issues with Wabbajack and how to fix them.
---

#### “A mod failed to download.”

First, you can try restarting the install once, you may also try enabling the Network Workaround option in the settings for Wabbajack to see if it will download the file after enabling that setting.

Next, check the list of commonly failing files further down on this page, some files hosted on certain file hosting sites are prone to failing at times.

Otherwise: wait for an update to the list. Please do not ask for anyone to share old files. I work a full-time job in addition to several other personal projects, of which Living Skyrim is just one. If installs are failing, I will try to update as quickly as possible but sometimes it may be a couple of days before I can get to it.

#### “Wabbajack says I’m out of requests.”

Nexus Premium is limited to 2500 downloads in a given 24 hour timeframe. Usually this limit resets around 9PM Eastern Time. Wait for your limit to reset and you’ll be able to proceed. Usually this only occurs after attempting to download the list multiple times in a row or when attempting to download multiple lists in the same 24 hour window.

#### “Can I pause the installation?”

Yes, just close Wabbajack. When you start the installation process again it will pick up from where it left off.

#### “Can I delete the downloads folder after installing?”

Yes, When using Wabbajack to update an existing install Wabbajack will only download the mods that have updated.

#### "Hashes for BSA don't match after extraction, Stock Game\Data\Skyrim - Animations.bsa"

This is an error that can occur sometimes, it is an issue with Wabbajack's install process. Please try closing Wabbajack and then running the installation again until the install successfully completes
