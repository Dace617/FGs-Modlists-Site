  How do I change brightness?
---

The brightness of any given location is entirely subjective. For some, it may be too dark. For others, it may be too bright. Before anything else, you should know that this is not a bug. The perceived brightness (or darkness, as the case may be) of a location is based on a huge number of factors:

- Your monitor and its brightness/gamma settings.
- Your in-game brightness/gamma settings.
- The lighting mod being used.
- The ENB preset being used.
- Your eyes, believe it or not.
- External lighting in your room, such as lamps and windows.
- GPU settings.

It is impossible for us to design a modlist with 100% perfect lighting for everyone. If you find the brightness/darkness too much in either direction, the only thing we can recommend is to change settings until it is at an acceptable level for you. The first things you should try are switching ENB presets and adjusting brightness/gamma settings.

Living Skyrim and Masterstroke include an optional mod you can enable to make things brighter that you can try. Those lists also come with an ESP called "Lux - Even Brighter Templates.esp" that you can safely disable if you would like to make it darker. No support is provided for adjusting lighting/brightness in the modlists beyond this, and exceeding what's written here falls under Rule 11.

Adjusting ENB Brightness:

These instructions are provided as is.

Instructions here are for the default ENB, if you have changed it you will need to search for the settings on your own. Open the ENB configuration menu in game with `Shift+Enter` Navigate to the `ENBEffect.fx` menu on the right side of the configuration screen. You will see two options near the top of this section, The first is the `Nights` modifier, Set this to a lower number between 0.5 and 1 to make nights brighter outdoors. Set it to a number between 1 and 2 to make them darker. Repeat this for the `Interiors` setting using the same number scale. Press **Save Configuration** in the top left and then close the menu using `Shift+Enter` again. ***DO NOT CLICK APPLY CHANGES*** This will load the configuration from the .ini file and you will lose your changes.
