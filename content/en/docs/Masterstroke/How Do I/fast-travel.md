Intended method:
- In any major hold you can pay a carriage driver or ferryman to travel.
- Craft a Travel Pack to fast travel from anywere. (Check the [Journeyman](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92220) mod for more details.)

Permanent fast-travel Toggle:
- Edit the .ini file from "Journeyman - A Fast Travel Overhaul":  
change "bEnableOnlyOnSurvivalEnabled=false" to "=true"
