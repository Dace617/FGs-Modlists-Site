## Mandatory Control and MCM Settings

When you are finished making your character, a bunch of text will start scrolling in the top left-hand corner of the screen. **Wait for all text to disappear from the top left before proceeding.** If you receive any pop-up messages during this wait, read them, then click through them. The MCM Recording will notify you when it has completed configuring the MCMs for you.

Now, *save your game*. Then *load that save.*

And that's it! The MCMs will be configured for you automatically and you can begin playing.
